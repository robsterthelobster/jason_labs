[CherryPy and Mako Installation]:
These instructions are somewhat long. Part of their purpose is to see if you will follow directions carefully. :-)

    Go to http://www.cherrypy.org/ and download CherryPy
    In the archive you will find a folder called "cherrypy". Move it to your project 	directory.
    Go to http://www.makotemplates.org/ and download Mako
    In the archive you will find a folder called "mako". Move it to your project 	directory.
    Download this archive and unpack it so the main.py and public-files items are in the 	project directory.
    Go to http://jquery.com and download jQuery. Put it in public-files  and rename it 	to jquery.js
    Go to http://jqueryui.com/ and download jQueryUI. Put it (and the theme files, if 	you want a custom theme) in public-files and rename the folder to jquery-ui
    Run the main.py file
    Point your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:1111 and verify that you see the home 	page.
